To use a custom icon for your Personal Diary application:

1. Create a .icns file (macOS) or .ico file (Windows)
2. Name it 'app_icon.icns' and place it in the same directory as this build script
3. Run the build script again

For macOS, you can convert images to .icns using tools like:
- iconutil (command line)
- Image2Icon (GUI application)
- Online converters like https://iconverticons.com/
